<span class="markdown">Illicit drug trade and trafficking pose significant challenges to societies worldwide, fueling crime, violence, public health crises, and undermining socioeconomic development [13]. Understanding the complex networks, behaviors, and dynamics involved in drug trafficking is crucial for developing effective interventions. Traditional approaches often lack a systematic framework for organizing and analyzing the vast amount of data and knowledge associated with this domain [7]. 

Ontologies offer a promising solution by providing a structured representation of concepts and relationships, enabling clearer insights into the nature of drug trafficking. By employing ontological principles, researchers can elucidate the underlying semantics and dynamics of drug trafficking systems, facilitating a deeper understanding of its intricacies and enabling more effective strategies for prevention, intervention, and law enforcement. Such models not only provide a comprehensive view of the phenomena but also serve as valuable tools for decision-makers to devise targeted policies and interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of drug trafficking and crimes on societies worldwide [9,12].

According to the literature, there is a lack of good ontologies in drug trafficking space although a lot of information available to model a base ontology from Global South countries that can help to reduce drug trafficking cases, and its impact in society. The main objective of developing a drug trafficking ontology is to examine the locations and times of incidents, identify the individuals involved (such as perpetrators, victims, and other relevant parties), determine the motives behind these occurrences, and provide specifics regarding the information source (such as news articles and official reports).</span>
