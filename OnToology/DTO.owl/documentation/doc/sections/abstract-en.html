<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontological modeling of drug trafficking involves constructing a structured representation of the entities, relationships, and processes within the domain of illicit drug trade. Limited ontologies are found in this space to represent entities and relations in publicly available corpora like unstructured newspaper data and online public reports. In this paper, we describe a process and modeling framework that can be used to construct an ontology for drug trafficking in the Global South. Our process aims to capture the complex interplay between various factors such as drug types, routes of transportation, distribution networks, and actors involved, including traffickers, dealers, and consumers. We rely on data collected from multiple independent sources, including newspapers and official reports e.g., The Hindu, Times of India, and dataUNODC, among others.</span>
